It is a fundamental physical quantity, used in conjunction with other quantities such as length, mass, and temperature.\n\nIn physics, time is often treated as a dimension, similar to the three dimensions of space, forming what we call \"four-dimensional spacetime\". This concept was developed by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity. \n\nTime can be measured using various units like seconds, minutes, hours etc., which are standardized globally through atomic clocks and other scientific instruments.\n\nIn terms of human experience, time is perceived as a continuous flow that moves forward from past to future. However, this perception varies among different cultures and philosophical perspectives. Some believe in the concept of eternity or timeless existence, while others see time as an illusion.\n\nOverall, time plays a crucial role in our understanding of the universe, organizing events and enabling us to predict and plan for"]}],"links":[[4,4,0,6,0,"STRING"],[5,4,0,7,0,"STRING"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ue_links":[],"links_added_by_ue":[],"ds":{"scale":0.7513148009015781,"offset":[110.52263096566996,603.8038025152264]}},"version":0.4}
